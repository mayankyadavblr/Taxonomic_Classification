# TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION

## Abstract
This is a project on ‘Taxonomy Database Management System’ .Here, we will attempt to design and make an efficient database for the classification of organisms, management of their data and to raise awareness about the loss of biodiversity.

In the finished stages, the project will be able to store large amounts of data on organisms according to standard hierarchy of classification, update the database and help visualize it by making graphs based on the existing population data. The purpose of these graphs is to raise awareness about the population of endangered species.

The project will help maintain consistency and uniformity in the ever changing field of taxonomical classification. This can help researchers gain insights and even help in identifying species or confirming the discovery of a new species. Students can easily access this data for effective learning and visualization.

### Inputs: 
species name, characteristics. 
### Output: 
All info on species and related species. Graph detailing the population status of species in a particular genus. And graph on the changes of a species’ population over the years.

### Edits:
Officials/admins can delete, modify and add to the database based on current discoveries. 
Users can suggest edits through the request table. Every edit in the request table is seen as a suggestion to the admins and only they have authority to accept or reject the suggestion.
